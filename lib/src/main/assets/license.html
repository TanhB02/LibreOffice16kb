        <h2>Cairo</h2>
        <p>The following software may be included in this product: Cairo. Use of any of this software is governed by
        the terms of the license below:</p>
        <p>Cairo is free software.</p>
        <p>Every source file in the implementation[*] of cairo is available to be redistributed and/or modified under
        the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License
        (MPL) version 1.1.  Some files are available under more liberal terms, but we believe that in all cases, each
        file may be used under either the LGPL or the MPL.</p>
        <p>See the following files in this directory for the precise terms and conditions of either license:</p>
        <p><span> <a href="#a__LGPL_version_2_1">Jump to LGPL Version 2.1</a></span></p>
        <p><span> <a href="#a__MPL_version_1_1">Jump to MPL Version 1.1</a></span></p>
        <p>Please see each file in the implementation for copyright and licensing information, (in the opening comment
        of each file).</p>
        <p>[*] The implementation of cairo is contained entirely within the "src" and "pixman" directories of the cairo
        source distribution. There are other components of the cairo source distribution (such as the "test" and
        "perf") that are auxiliary to the library itself. None of the source code in these directories contributes to a
        build of the cairo library itself, (libcairo.so or cairo.dll or similar).</p>
        <p>These auxiliary components are also free software, but may be under different license terms than cairo
        itself. For example, most of the test cases in the perf and test directories are made available under a MIT
        license to simplify any use of this code for reference purposes in using cairo itself. Other files might be
        available under the GNU General Public License (GPL), for example. Again, please see the opening comment of
        each file for copyright and licensing information.</p>

        <h3>Why Three Licenses?</h3>
        <p>The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD License, and since the IJG
        License effectively subsumes the distribution conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively
        placed libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License. However, the IJG License specifically refers
        to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.
        Thus, it was desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code that were granted
        to the IJG for code derived from their software.</p>

        Independent JPEG Group's software".</p>
        <p>We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided
        that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.</p>
        <p>ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its
        copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and
        conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you
        must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since
        ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
        the foregoing paragraphs do.</p>
        <p>The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free
        Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess,
        config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also
        freely distributable.</p>
        <p>It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T,
        and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For
        this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic
        coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
        implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
        code.</p>
        <p>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the
        Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
        produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are
        larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.</p>
        <p>We are required to state that</p>
        <blockquote>
            "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a
            Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

        i.e. PDFs requires the free publication of the PDF as well. This is why our GPL contains the so called "font

        <h3>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005</h3>
        <p>PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of cooperative font
        projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
        framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.</p>
        <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are
        not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and
        sold with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
        however, cannot be released under any other type of license.</p>

        <p>Original license text: This file is part of hyph-utf8 package and resulted from semi-manual conversions of
        hyphenation patterns into UTF-8 in June 2008.</p>
        <p>Source: hrhyph.tex (1996-04-10) Author: Marinović Igor &lt;migor at student.math.hr&gt;</p>
        <p>The above mentioned file should become obsolete, and the author of the original file should preferably
        modify this file instead.</p>
        <p>Modifications were needed in order to support native UTF-8 engines, but functionality (hopefully) didn't
        change in any way, at least not intentionally. This file is no longer stand-alone; at least for 8-bit engines
        you probably want to use loadhyph-foo.tex (which will load this file) instead.</p>
        <p>Modifications were done by Jonathan Kew, Mojca Miklavec &amp; Arthur Reutenauer with help &amp; support
        from: - Karl Berry, who gave us free hands and all resources - Taco Hoekwater, with useful macros - Hans Hagen,
        who did the unicodifisation of patterns already long before and helped with testing, suggestions and bug
        reports - Norbert Preining, who tested &amp; integrated patterns into TeX Live</p>
        <p>However, the "copyright/copyleft" owner of patterns remains the original author.</p>
        <p>The copyright statement of this file is thus:</p>
        <p>Do with this file whatever needs to be done in future for the sake of "a better world" as long as you
        respect the copyright of original file. If you're the original author of patterns or taking over a new
        revolution, please remove all of the TUG comments &amp; credits that we added here - you are the Queen / the
        King, we are only the servants.</p>
        <p>If you want to change this file, rather than uploading directly to CTAN, we would be grateful if you could
        send it to us (<a href="http://tug.org/tex-hyphen">http://tug.org/tex-hyphen</a>) or ask for credentials for
        SVN repository and commit it yourself; we will then upload the whole "package" to CTAN.</p>
        <p>Before a new "pattern-revolution" starts, please try to follow some guidelines if possible:</p>
        <p>- \lccode is *forbidden*, and I really mean it - all the patterns should be in UTF-8 - the only "allowed"
        TeX commands in this file are: \patterns, \hyphenation, and if you really cannot do without, also \input and
        \message - in particular, please no \catcode or \lccode changes, they belong to loadhyph-foo.tex, and no
        \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin, they have no influence here and belong elsewhere - \begingroup and/or
        \endinput is not needed - feel free to do whatever you want inside comments</p>
        <p>We know that TeX is extremely powerful, but give a stupid parser at least a chance to read your
        patterns.</p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="http://tug.org/tex-hyphen">http://tug.org/tex-hyphen</a></p>

        <p>These dictionaries are created using the speller/make-hunspell-dict</p>
        <p>dictionary in SCOWL, SVN revision 74.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The NOSUGGEST flag was added to certain taboo words.  While I made an</p>
        <p>honest attempt to flag the strongest taboo words with the NOSUGGEST</p>
        <p>flag, I MAKE NO GUARANTEE THAT I FLAGGED EVERY POSSIBLE TABOO WORD.</p>
        <p>The list was originally derived from Németh László, however I removed</p>
        <p>some words which, while being considered taboo by some dictionaries,</p>
        <p>are not really considered swear words in today's society.</p>

        <p>feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the</p>
        <p>Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to</p>
        <p>the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most</p>
        <p>common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and</p>
        <p>frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist</p>
        <p>with Frequency Classification".</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>    The Moby lexicon project is complete and has</p>
        <p>    been place into the public domain. Use, sell,</p>
        <p>    rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>    Placing this material on internal or public servers is</p>
        <p>    also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any</p>

        <p>The "UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification" is also in the</p>
        <p>Public Domain:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>  Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 20:27:21 +0100</p>
        <p>  From: Brian Kelk &lt;Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk&gt;</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>  &gt; I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English</p>
        <p>  &gt; Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to</p>
        <p>  &gt; be lacking any copyright notice.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>  There were many many sources in total, but any text marked</p>
        <p>  "copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one</p>
        <p>  source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called</p>
        <p>  PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public</p>
        <p>  domain.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>  Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>  &gt; So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>  That is the intention.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at</p>
        <p>least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All</p>
        <p>words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via</p>
        <p>my inflection database.</p>
        <p> </p>

        <p>myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in</p>
        <p>other word lists is included.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The name files form the Census report is a government document which I</p>
        <p>don't think can be copyrighted.</p>

        <p>The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version</p>
        <p>4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also</p>
        <p>in the public domain.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The 60 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and all words</p>
        <p>appearing in at least 2 of the 12 dictionaries as indicated by the</p>

        <p>21,986 names list from the MWords package The common dictionary words,</p>
        <p>like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections</p>
        <p>added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of</p>
        <p>the 12Dics package which is the public domain</p>

        <p><tt>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY
        USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</tt></p>
        <p><tt><strong>1. DEFINITIONS</strong></tt></p>
        <p><tt>"Contribution" means:</tt></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><tt>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this
            Agreement, and</tt></p>
            <p><tt>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</tt></p>
            <p><tt>i) changes to the Program, and</tt></p>
            <p><tt>ii) additions to the Program;</tt></p>
            <p><tt>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that
            particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
            such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
            additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
            Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><tt>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</tt></p>
        <p><tt>"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by
        the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</tt></p>
        <p><tt>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</tt></p>
        <p><tt>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all
        Contributors.</tt></p>
        <p><tt><strong>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</strong></tt></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><tt>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
            worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
            publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
            derivative works, in source code and object code form.</tt></p>
            <p><tt>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
            worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
            otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This
            patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
            Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
            covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include
            the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</tt></p>
            <p><tt>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
            forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent
            or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
            Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
            otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
            assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example,
            if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's
            responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.</tt></p>
            <p><tt>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
            Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><tt><strong>3. REQUIREMENTS</strong></tt></p>
        <p><tt>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
        provided that:</tt></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><tt>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</tt></p>
            <p><tt>b) its license agreement:</tt></p>
            <p><tt>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and
            implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
            conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</tt></p>
            <p><tt>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct,
            indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</tt></p>
            <p><tt>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor
            alone and not by any other party; and</tt></p>
            <p><tt>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs
            licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
            exchange.</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><tt>When the Program is made available in source code form:</tt></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><tt>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</tt></p>
            <p><tt>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><tt>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.</tt></p>
        <p><tt>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
        reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</tt></p>
        <p><tt><strong>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</strong></tt></p>
        <p><tt>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users,
        business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
        the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does
        not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
        commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
        every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
        "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
        Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
        connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
        section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
        infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
        Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
        the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor
        may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</tt></p>
        <p><tt>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That
        Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or
        offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
        Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
        against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
        other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</tt></p>
        <p><tt><strong>5. NO WARRANTY</strong></tt></p>
        <p><tt>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
        is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
        risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
        costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
        unavailability or interruption of operations.</tt></p>
        <p><tt><strong>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</strong></tt></p>
        <p><tt>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY
        LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT
        LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
        OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR
        THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</tt></p>
        <p><tt><strong>7. GENERAL</strong></tt></p>
        <p><tt>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
        the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by
        the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
        valid and enforceable.</tt></p>
        <p><tt>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to
        software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
        Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
        addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
        in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
        hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall
        terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</tt></p>
        <p><tt>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
        material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
        after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient
        agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
        obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
        and survive.</tt></p>
        <p><tt>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid
        inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement
        Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
        No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement
        Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.
        Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
        Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received.
        In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
        (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
        above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
        Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly
        granted under this Agreement are reserved.</tt></p>
        <p><tt>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of
        the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
        than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting
        litigation.</tt></p>

    <p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
    including without limitation Section <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_section-2.2">2.2</a>. The Source Code version of Covered
    Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
    Section <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_section-6.1">6.1</a>, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of

    <h3 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-3.2">3.2. Availability of Source Code.</h3>
    <p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
    the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
    Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
    Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
    initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
    has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
    available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p>
    <h3 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-3.3">3.3. Description of Modifications.</h3>
    <p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
    create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
    is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
    the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
    documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p>
    <h3 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-3.4">3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</h3>
    <h4 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-3.4-a">(a) Third Party Claims</h4>
    <p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to
    exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_section-2.1">2.1</a> or <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_section-2.2">2.2</a>, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
    "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know
    whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
    Section <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_section-3.2">3.2</a>, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
    Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
    newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
    obtained.</p>
    <h4 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-3.4-b">(b) Contributor APIs</h4>
    <p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
    patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that <abbr>API</abbr>, Contributor must also include
    this information in the <strong class="very-strong">legal</strong> file.</p>
    <h4 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-3.4-c">(c) Representations.</h4>
    <p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (<a href="#mpl_v_1_1_section-3.4-a">a</a>) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's
    original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>

    <p>You must duplicate the notice in <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> in each file of the Source Code.
    If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
    include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
    notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
    in <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a>. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
    Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to
    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
    Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
    is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability terms You offer.</p>

    Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of
    how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_section-3.2">3.2</a>. The notice
    must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which
    You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
    Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
    does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
    this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
    that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>
    <h3 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-3.7">3.7. Larger Works.</h3>

    License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
    <h2 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-4">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</h2>
    <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
    Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
    included in the <strong class="very-strong">legal</strong> file described in Section <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_section-3.4">3.4</a> and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
    ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
    <h2 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-5">5. Application of this License.</h2>
    <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> and to related Covered Code.</p>

    time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.</p>
    <h3 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-6.2">6.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>
    <p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use
    it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
    version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
    applicable to Covered Code created under this License.</p>
    <h3 id="mpl_v_1_1_section-6.3">6.3. Derivative Works</h3>
    <p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code
    which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
    "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
    license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your
    version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.
    (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in <a href="#mpl_v_1_1_exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)</p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to
            use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
            Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and

        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>2.2. Effective Date</h3>
    <p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on
    the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.</p>
    <h3>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</h3>
    <p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or
    licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding
    Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party´s modifications of Covered Software, or
            (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version);
            or</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as
    may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>
    <h3>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</h3>
    <p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a
    subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under
    the terms of Section 3.3).</p>
    <h3>2.5. Representation</h3>
    <p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it
    has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>
    <h3>2.6. Fair Use</h3>
    <p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair
    dealing, or other equivalents.</p>
    <h3>2.7. Conditions</h3>
    <p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.</p>
    <h2>3. Responsibilities</h2>
    <h3>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</h3>
    <p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to
    which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
    of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License.
    You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients´ rights in the Source Code Form.</p>
    <h3>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</h3>
    <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and
            You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient;
            and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under
            different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
            recipients´ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</h3>
    <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the
    requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
    a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary
    Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
    Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
    Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p>
    <h3>3.4. Notices</h3>
    <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices,
    disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
    Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual
    inaccuracies.</p>
    <h3>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</h3>
    <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one
    or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation
    is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
    Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
    disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.</p>
    <h2>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h2>
    <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
    Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
    License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
    must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to
    the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
    ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
    <h2>5. Termination</h2>
    <p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its
    terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
    are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
    and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
    prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
    reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means,
    this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You
    become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p>
    <p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered
    Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
    <p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
    distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
    termination shall survive termination.</p>
    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
    <p><em>Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind,
    either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
    free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality
    and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
    You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
    warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
    License except under this disclaimer.</em></p>
    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><em>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You
    for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without
    limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
    all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such
    damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
    party´s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
    exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to
    You.</em></p>
    <h2>8. Litigation</h2>
    <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant
    maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,
    without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party´s ability to
    bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</p>
    <h2>9. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
    License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
    drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>
    <h2>10. Versions of the License</h2>
    <h3>10.1. New Versions</h3>
    <p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license
    steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
    distinguishing version number.</p>
    <h3>10.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>
    <p>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
    received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.</p>
    <h3>10.3. Modified Versions</h3>
    <p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you
    may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the
    name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).</p>
    <h3>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses</h3>
    <p>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of
    this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</p>
    <h2>Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice</h2>

    <p>PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font
    projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
    open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.</p>
    <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not
    sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold
    with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives, however,
    cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not
    apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
    <p>DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license
    and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
    <p>"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).</p>
    <p>"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright
    Holder(s).</p>
    <p>"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting – in part or in whole
    -- any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
    environment.</p>
    <p>"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the
    Font Software.</p>
    <p>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the
    Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of
    the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>
    <p>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold
    by itself.</p>
    <p>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any
    software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included
    either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields
    within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>
    <p>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission
    is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
    presented to the users.</p>
    <p>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote,
    endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and
    the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.</p>
    <p>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this
    license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
    license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.</p>

    BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF

    DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER

    conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."</p>
    <p>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been
    received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Grant of Copyright License</strong>. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
    distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Grant of Patent License</strong>. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
    otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
    that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the
    Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
    a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
    constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
    for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Redistribution</strong>. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
    following conditions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</li>
        <li>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and</li>
        <li>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
        trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</li>
        <li>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
        distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
        those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
        within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
        purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
        that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
        additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright
        statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your
        use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
        License.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>5. Submission of Contributions</strong>. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede
    or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
    Contributions.</p>
    <p><strong>6. Trademarks</strong>. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
    service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
    the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Disclaimer of Warranty</strong>. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
    provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
    CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
    determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
    exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
    <p><strong>8. Limitation of Liability</strong>. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
    acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
    special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the
    use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,

    been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
    <p><strong>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</strong>. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
    Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
    liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
    act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if

        <p><em>LPPL Version 1.3c 2008-05-04</em></p>
        <p><strong>Copyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project</strong></p>
        <p>Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not
        allowed.</p>
        <h2><a name="item1" id="item1">PREAMBLE</a></h2>
        <p>The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the LaTeX kernel and the base
        LaTeX packages are distributed.</p>
        <p>You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute. This
        license may be particularly suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but it is written
        in such a way that you can use it even if your work is unrelated to TeX.</p>
        <p>The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples,
        and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license.</p>
        <p>This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions
        under which modified versions of that work may be distributed.</p>
        <p>We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute
        modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining
        the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while
        meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX
        distribution for suggestions.</p>
        <h2><a name="item2" id="item2">DEFINITIONS</a></h2>
        <p>In this license document the following terms are used:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>`Work'</dt>
            <dd>Any work being distributed under this License.</dd>
            <dt>`Derived Work'</dt>
            <dd>Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.</dd>
            <dt>`Modification'</dt>
            <dd>Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law — for example, the production of
            a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of such a file, either
            verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</dd>
            <dt>`Modify'</dt>
            <dd>To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law.</dd>
            <dt>`Distribution'</dt>
            <dd>Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in part. Distribution
            includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by file transfer
            protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).</dd>
            <dt>`Compiled Work'</dt>
            <dd>A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer
            system. This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations of
            the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that modification of any
            installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.</dd>
            <dt>`Current Maintainer'</dt>
            <dd>A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is no such explicit nomination then it
            is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.</dd>
            <dt>`Base Interpreter'</dt>
            <dd>A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the
            Work.<br/>
            <br/>
            A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the Base
            Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used
            interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable Base
            Interpreter is a `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the `LaTeX-format' a program
            implementing the `TeX language'.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2><a name="item3" id="item3">CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this license;
            they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no
            requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.</li>
            <li>You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of only
            part of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may
            be assumed under the terms of this clause.</li>
            <li>You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work
            as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the
            recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they
            generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.</li>
            <li>If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus
            creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including Compiled
            Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer
            are considered to be updated versions of the Work.</li>
            <li>If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus creating
            a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the
            Derived Work.</li>
            <li>If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the
            following conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states in the
            copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such
            statements of exemption to a component of the Work.
                <ol>
                    <li>If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of the Work
                    when that component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work
                    identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the replacement
                    component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of
                    this component to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter.</li>
                    <li>Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the
                    changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of
                    the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.</li>
                    <li>No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but not limited to) the
                    authors of the original version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)
                    the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons have
                    stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived Work.</li>
                    <li>You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
                        <ol>
                            <li>A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component
                            is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then
                            offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
                            condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the
                            modified component;</li>
                            <li>Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work generated from a
            Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as
            long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work.</li>
            <li>The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by any
            method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work
            as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.</li>
            <li>Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that Derived
            Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or
            nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process.</li>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors
                    the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor
                    the rest of the conditions in this license.</li>
                    <li>If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that Derived Work must provide
                    sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor
                    the restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor does this license
            place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means.</li>
            <li>Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties
            with all applicable laws.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="item4" id="item4">NO WARRANTY</a></h2>
        <p>There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides
        the Work `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
        implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality
        and performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary
        servicing, repair, or correction.</p>
        <p>In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any
        author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as
        permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential
        damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to,
        loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the
        Work to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has
        been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
        <h2><a name="item5" id="item5">MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK</a></h2>
        <p>The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly and prominently states near
        the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply
        that it is `author-maintained'.</p>
        <p>The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in the Work that
        they are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It
        is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.</p>
        <p>The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current Maintainer, or the person
        stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for
        a period of six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance.</p>
        <p>You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing Current Maintainer to take
        over this role.</p>
        <p>If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the following
        steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the two differ)
            through the means of an Internet or similar search.</li>
            <li>If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained.
                <ol>
                    <li>If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their communication data
                    within one month.</li>
                    <li>If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current
                    Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance.
                    (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to you, then
                    this takes effect immediately upon announcement.</li>
                    <li>If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of
                    the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after three months your intention
            is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then you
            may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.</li>
            <li>If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a
            change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the
            Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the Work is distributed under
        the LPPL license.</p>
        <p>If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work, a
        prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also announce your new
        status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above.</p>
        <h2><a name="item6" id="item6">WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE</a></h2>
        <p>This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering
        distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in this section.</p>
        <h3>Choosing This License or Another License</h3>
        <p>If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly
        from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute
        your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but
        your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under
        the LPPL.</p>
        <p>The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of
        this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was
        considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still
        be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it.</p>
        <h3>A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution</h3>
        <p>It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the
        above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such modifications will
        never be distributed, often this will happen by accident — you may forget that you have modified that
        component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus
        distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and,
        worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the
        Work identical with the public one. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without
        altering any of its licensed components.</p>
        <h3>How to Use This License</h3>
        <p>To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice
        including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a
        statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this
        license.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of such a notice and statement:</p>
        <pre>
  %% pig.dtx
  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
  %
  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.
  % The latest version of this license is in
  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
  % version 2005/12/01 or later.
  %
  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.
  %
  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.
  %
  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
  % and the derived file pig.sty.
</pre>
        <p>Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with
        the `Work' referring to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being generated from
        `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter' referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder'
        and `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.</p>
        <p>If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change `maintained' above into
        `author-maintained'. However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance section was added in
        order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support
        it yourself.</p>
        <h3>Derived Works That Are Not Replacements</h3>
        <p>Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and stability for the user community. They
        therefore concern themselves with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a (compatible or
        incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are
        reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.</p>
        <h3>Important Recommendations</h3>
        <h4>Defining What Constitutes the Work</h4>
        <p>The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore
        important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for
        example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or
        by using a line such as:</p>
        <pre>
    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.
</pre>
        <p>in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine
        what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make
        reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.</p>

    AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.</p>
    <p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS

    <p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>"Adaptation"</strong> means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing

        literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other
        form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from
        the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the
        purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
        phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
        considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.</li>
        <li><strong>"Collection"</strong> means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
        anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
        listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
        intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
        other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
        assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
        (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.</li>
        <li><strong>"Creative Commons Compatible License"</strong> means a license that is listed at
        https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially
        equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the
        same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
        relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons
        jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.</li>

        expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who
        first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization
        that transmits the broadcast.</li>
        <li><strong>"Work"</strong> means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License
        including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
        the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
        lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a

    <p><strong>2. Fair Dealing Rights.</strong> Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
    uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with
    the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.</p>
    <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants
    You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
        incorporated in the Collections;</li>
        <li>to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any
        medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
        original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to
        Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";</li>
        <li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,</li>
        <li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.</li>
        <li>
            <p>For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li><strong>Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes</strong>. In those jurisdictions in which the right
                to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
                Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
                granted under this License;</li>
                <li><strong>Waivable Compulsory License Schemes</strong>. In those jurisdictions in which the right to
                collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
                waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
                under this License; and,</li>
                <li><strong>Voluntary License Schemes</strong>. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
                whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
                administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
                granted under this License.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
    rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
    media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
    limited by the following restrictions:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a
        copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute
        or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License
        or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
        the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
        to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
        Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
        that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
        under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
        does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
        You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
        Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
        any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
        4(c), as requested.</li>
        <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a
        later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
        jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
        License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the
        Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you
        license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
        License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I)
        You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
        Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
        terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
        granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices
        that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as
        included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
        Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
        of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
        the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this
        does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
        Applicable License.</li>
        <li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
        request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
        reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
        applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
        (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
        copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
        title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
        specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
        information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
        identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author,"
        or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
        implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
        minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
        appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
        contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
        purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may
        not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
        Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
        separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</li>
        <li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law,
        if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
        Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
        which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
        jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the
        right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
        action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
        appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
        reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
        otherwise.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>
    <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
    ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
    LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Termination</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
        terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
        License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
        compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
        License.</li>
        <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
        applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
        under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
        election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
        granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
        terminated as stated above.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient
        a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</li>
        <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
        the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</li>
        <li>If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
        validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
        parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
        provision valid and enforceable.</li>
        <li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver
        or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</li>
        <li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
        There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.
        Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This
        License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.</li>
        <li>The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
        terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September
        28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
        Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
        matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according
        to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
        law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
        granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is
        not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.</li>

    <p class="usage-considerations"><strong>Considerations for licensors:</strong> Our public licenses are intended for
        use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright
        and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and

        before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly
        mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under

    <p class="usage-considerations"><strong>Considerations for the public:</strong> By using one of our public
        licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and
        conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable
        exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
        permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the
        licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other
        rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or
        described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
        reasonable. <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensees">More
